# Pet-Insurance-Project
This project simulates the financial dynamics of pet insurance in the U.S. using real-world 2023 data (NAPHIA, ASPCA, Pawlicy Advisor). It was built to explore whether insurance is profitable for providers â€” and whether it actually pays off for dog owners.


- Simulated 10,000 insured dogs using R
 
- Claim frequency modeled with Poisson distribution (~0.7/year)

- Claim severity modeled with lognormal distribution
  
- Insurance terms: $675 annual premium, $250 deductible, $5,000 limit
  
- Compared insurer profit vs. owner out-of-pocket costs


- R (base + `rpois`, `rlnorm`)
- Data sources: NAPHIA 2023, ASPCA, Pawlicy Advisor
